  Generate comprehensive strategic SWOT analysis for pharmaceutical and biotechnology
  companies by collecting data from 5 MCP servers: clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov),
  financial data (SEC EDGAR), FDA approved products, patent portfolio (USPTO/Google Patents),
  and market performance (Yahoo Finance). Creates evidence-based assessment of Strengths,
  Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats with supporting data from regulatory filings,
  clinical development pipelines, intellectual property portfolios, and market metrics.

  Use this skill when you need strategic competitive intelligence on pharmaceutical companies,
  biotech acquisition targets, or investment analysis. Triggers: "company analysis",
  "competitive assessment", "strategic evaluation", "company SWOT", "pharma company profile",
  "biotech company analysis".

## Implementation Details

### Multi-Server Data Collection Pattern

The skill follows a proven multi-server pattern:

1. **Parallel data collection** from 5 independent sources
2. **Graceful degradation** - continues if individual server fails
3. **Structured aggregation** - combines heterogeneous data formats
4. **Evidence-based categorization** - each SWOT point backed by data

### Response Formats Handled

- **Markdown parsing:** ClinicalTrials.gov responses (regex extraction)
- **JSON parsing:** FDA, Patents, Financial data (dict traversal)
- **XBRL parsing:** SEC EDGAR financial concepts (simplified extraction)

### Error Handling

Each data source collection includes:
- Try-catch exception handling
- Success/failure flags in return dict
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- Continues execution even if individual sources fail
