description: >
  Generic skill to identify therapeutic areas and indications where ANY pharmaceutical
  company is actively developing drugs by analyzing their clinical trial pipeline.
  Searches for trials with active statuses (Recruiting, Active not recruiting,
  Enrolling by invitation) and aggregates conditions with phase distribution and
  status breakdown. Provides indication-level insights including trial counts,
  phase distribution, and status breakdown per therapeutic area. Use this skill
  when analyzing company development strategy, pipeline focus areas, competitive
  positioning, or therapeutic area expansion for ANY pharmaceutical company.
  Keywords: company pipeline, indications, therapeutic areas, active development,
  drug candidates, clinical trials portfolio, strategic focus, pipeline analysis.

## Sample Queries

Examples of user queries that would trigger reuse of this skill:

1. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist What therapeutic areas is Novo Nordisk actively developing drugs for?`
2. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Show me Pfizer's pipeline by indication and disease area`
3. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Which indications does Eli Lilly have in active clinical development?`
4. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Analyze Bristol Myers Squibb's strategic focus areas across their active trial portfolio`
5. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist What diseases is AstraZeneca targeting with their current drug development pipeline?`


## Purpose

Generic skill to identify what indications (therapeutic areas) ANY pharmaceutical company is actively developing drugs for by analyzing their clinical trial pipeline. Filters for active development statuses and aggregates conditions to reveal strategic focus areas.

## Usage

Use this skill when you need to:
- Understand any company's current development priorities
- Identify therapeutic areas of strategic focus for a competitor
- Analyze pipeline breadth across indications for any pharma company
- Compare development activity across disease areas
- Support competitive intelligence and business development decisions
- Discover which companies are targeting specific therapeutic areas

**Trigger keywords**: company pipeline, indications by company, therapeutic areas targeting, pipeline focus, strategic focus areas, company development priorities

## Implementation Details

**Data Source**: ClinicalTrials.gov (ct_gov_mcp)

**Search Strategy**:
- Query: Company name (parameterized)
- Status filter: RECRUITING, ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING, ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION
- Pagination: Handles full dataset with token-based pagination

**Processing Logic**:
1. Fetches all active company trials using pagination
2. Extracts conditions (indications) from each trial
3. Splits multi-condition entries (comma/semicolon separated)
4. Aggregates by indication with:
   - Total trial count
   - Phase distribution
   - Status breakdown
   - Sample NCT IDs for reference
5. Sorts by trial count to prioritize key indications

**Output Structure**:
```python
{
    'total_trials': int,
    'unique_indications': int,
    'indication_details': [
        {
            'indication': str,
            'trial_count': int,
            'phase_distribution': str,
            'status_distribution': str,
            'sample_nct_ids': [str]
        }
    ],
    'summary': str
}
```

## Key Differences vs Other Skills

### vs `get_clinical_trials` (Therapeutic Area Generic)
- **That**: Get trials for ANY therapeutic area (e.g., "GLP-1", "KRAS inhibitor")
- **This**: Get indications for ANY company (e.g., "Novo Nordisk", "Pfizer")
- **Aggregation**: Therapeutic area → trials | Company → indications

### vs `get_company_clinical_trials_portfolio` (Company Portfolio)
- **That**: Overall status/phase counts (e.g., "50% Phase 3, 30% Phase 2")
- **This**: Indication-level breakdown (e.g., "Obesity: 14 trials, Diabetes: 11 trials")
- **Insight**: Overall metrics | Strategic focus by disease area

**This skill answers**: "What diseases/indications is the company targeting?"
**Other skills answer**: "How many trials does the company have?"

## Example Usage

### Python Import
```python
from .claude.skills.company_pipeline_indications.scripts.get_company_pipeline_indications import get_company_pipeline_indications

# Analyze Novo Nordisk pipeline
result = get_company_pipeline_indications(company="Novo Nordisk")
print(f"Total active trials: {result['total_trials']}")
print(f"Unique indications: {result['unique_indications']}")

# Top 5 indications
for detail in result['indication_details'][:5]:
    print(f"{detail['indication']}: {detail['trial_count']} trials")
    print(f"  Phases: {detail['phase_distribution']}")
```

### Command Line
```bash
# Novo Nordisk
PYTHONPATH=.claude:$PYTHONPATH python3 \
  .claude/skills/company-pipeline-indications/scripts/get_company_pipeline_indications.py \
