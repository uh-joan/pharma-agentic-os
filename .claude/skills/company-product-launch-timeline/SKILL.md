## Returns

Correlated FDA approvals and clinical trials with timeline analysis.
## Purpose
Correlate FDA device approvals with supporting clinical trials to understand product development timelines, approval paths, and commercialization strategy for medical device companies.

## Key Features
- Multi-skill composition: Imports two dependency skills for comprehensive analysis
- Fuzzy matching: Correlates trials to approvals using similarity scoring
- Timeline visualization: Shows products with supporting trials chronologically
- Strategic insights: Calculates trial-to-approval time, approval pathways, active pipeline

## Usage
```python
from .claude.skills.company_product_launch_timeline.scripts.analyze_company_product_launch_timeline import analyze_company_product_launch_timeline

result = analyze_company_product_launch_timeline(
    company_name="Boston Scientific",
    focus_area="cardiovascular",
    start_year=2020
)

print(result['summary'])
```
