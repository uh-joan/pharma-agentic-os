name: get_breakthrough_therapy_designations_2024
description: >
  Retrieves FDA drug approvals from 2024 and identifies breakthrough therapy
  designations where available in the API. Provides drug name, indication,
  approval date, sponsor, and mechanism of action.

  IMPORTANT: The FDA drug labels API may not contain complete breakthrough
  designation data. For authoritative breakthrough therapy designation lists,
  consult FDA's official breakthrough therapy webpage or drug approval
  announcements.

  Use this skill when analyzing:
  - Fast-track regulatory strategies
  - Competitive intelligence for 2024 approvals
  - Novel mechanisms of action in recent approvals
  - Rare disease drug development trends

## Sample Queries

Examples of user queries that would trigger reuse of this skill:

1. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist What drugs received breakthrough therapy designation and FDA approval in 2024?`
2. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Show me 2024 FDA approvals with fast-track regulatory pathways`
3. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Which therapeutic areas received breakthrough therapy designations in 2024?`
4. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Analyze novel mechanisms of action in 2024 breakthrough therapy approvals`
5. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Get competitive intelligence on 2024 FDA breakthrough-designated drugs`


## Purpose

Retrieves all FDA drug approvals from 2024 and identifies breakthrough therapy designations where this information is available in the FDA drug labels API.

Breakthrough therapy designation is granted by FDA to accelerate development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions that demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies.

## Usage

**When to use this skill**:
- Analyzing fast-track regulatory strategies for 2024
- Competitive intelligence on novel drug approvals
- Understanding recent therapeutic innovations
- Identifying emerging mechanisms of action
- Tracking rare disease drug development

**Example queries**:
- "What drugs got breakthrough designation in 2024?"
- "List FDA approvals from 2024"
- "Show me recent breakthrough therapies"

## Data Sources

- **FDA Drug Labels API**: Primary source for approval dates and drug information
- **Search Strategy**: Filters drugs by 2024 marketing status dates
- **Limitation**: Breakthrough designation status may not be fully captured in API structured fields

## Implementation Details

### Search Strategy

1. Queries FDA drug labels database for broad sample (limit: 100)
2. Filters results by `marketing_status_date` containing "2024"
3. Extracts drug information from `openfda` fields
4. Checks `submissions` array for breakthrough designation indicators

### Data Extracted

For each 2024 approval:
- **Brand name**: Commercial product name
- **Generic name**: Active ingredient name
- **Application number**: NDA/BLA number
- **Sponsor**: Pharmaceutical company
- **Approval date**: Marketing status date
- **Indication**: Therapeutic use
- **Mechanism**: Mechanism of action (MoA)
- **Breakthrough status**: If found in submission data

### Known Limitations

1. **Incomplete Breakthrough Data**: FDA drug labels API does not consistently include breakthrough designation in structured fields
2. **Sample Size**: Default query retrieves 100-drug sample; may not capture all 2024 approvals
3. **Verification Needed**: For authoritative breakthrough designation list, consult:
   - FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designations webpage
   - FDA drug approval press releases
   - CenterWatch or FDA RSS feeds

## Output Format

Returns dictionary with:
```python
{
    'total_count': int,           # Total 2024 approvals found
    'breakthrough_count': int,    # Confirmed breakthrough designations in API
    'drugs': [                    # List of drug information dictionaries
        {
            'brand_name': str,
            'generic_name': str,
            'application_number': str,
            'sponsor': str,
            'approval_date': str,
            'indication': str,
            'mechanism': str,
            'breakthrough_designated': bool,
            'submission_info': str
        }
    ],
    'summary': str                # Formatted summary table
}
```
