## Example Use Cases

### 1. Alzheimer's Disease Target Discovery

```python
from .claude.skills.disease_genetic_targets.scripts.get_disease_genetic_targets import get_disease_genetic_targets

# Get top genetic targets for Alzheimer's
result = get_disease_genetic_targets(
    disease_query="Alzheimer's disease",
    min_genetic_score=0.5,  # Strong genetic evidence only
    top_n=10
)

# Top target: APOE (genetic score: 0.887)
# Known drugs: LECANEMAB (Phase 4), ADUCANUMAB (Phase 3)
```

### 2. Type 2 Diabetes Target Prioritization

```python
result = get_disease_genetic_targets(
    disease_query="Type 2 diabetes",
    min_genetic_score=0.3,
    top_n=50
)

# Prioritize by genetic evidence + tractability
tractable_targets = [
    t for t in result['targets']
    if t.get('tractability', {}).get('smallmolecule')
]
```

### 3. Rare Disease with High Threshold

```python
result = get_disease_genetic_targets(
    disease_query="Huntington disease",
    min_genetic_score=0.7,  # Very strong evidence required
    top_n=5
)
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Collection Strategy

1. **Disease Search**: Queries Open Targets to find disease EFO identifier
2. **Association Retrieval**: Gets target-disease associations with automatic pagination
   - Fetches in batches of 100 records
   - Continues until reaching `max_fetch` or all available records
   - Default: 5000 targets (50 pages)
   - Maximum: 50,000 targets (500 pages)
3. **Genetic Filtering**: Filters for targets with genetic evidence above threshold
4. **Drug Enrichment**: Fetches known drugs for each target
5. **Tractability Assessment**: Includes antibody/small molecule tractability

### Pagination Performance

The skill uses automatic pagination to fetch large datasets:

- **100 records** (1 page): ~1-2 seconds
- **500 records** (5 pages): ~5-10 seconds
- **1,000 records** (10 pages): ~10-15 seconds
- **5,000 records** (50 pages): ~20-30 seconds (default)
- **12,874 records** (128 pages): ~60-90 seconds (Alzheimer's full dataset)

**Recommendation**: Use default `max_fetch=5000` for comprehensive analysis while maintaining reasonable performance.

### Evidence Types

The skill integrates multiple evidence types from Open Targets:

- **Genetic Association** (Primary): GWAS, rare variants, somatic mutations
- **Literature**: Text mining and manual curation
- **Animal Model**: Phenotype data from model organisms
- **Known Drug**: Existing pharmacology and clinical precedence
- **RNA Expression**: Differential expression patterns

### Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| 0.7 - 1.0 | Very strong evidence | Top priority targets |
| 0.5 - 0.7 | Strong evidence | High confidence targets |
| 0.3 - 0.5 | Moderate evidence | Consider with other factors |
| 0.0 - 0.3 | Weak evidence | Likely false positive |

### Tractability Assessment

Targets are assessed for drug development feasibility:

- **Antibody tractability**: Extracellular/secreted proteins, known epitopes
- **Small molecule tractability**: Druggable domains, structural information
- **Clinical precedence**: Existing drugs for related indications

## Key Findings: Alzheimer's Disease

Based on execution results:

**Top 5 Genetic Targets**:
1. **APOE** (genetic: 0.887) - Lipid metabolism, strongest genetic risk factor
   - Known drugs: LECANEMAB (Phase 4), ADUCANUMAB (Phase 3), ALZ-801 (Phase 3)
2. **PICALM** (genetic: 0.638) - Endocytosis, clathrin-mediated
   - No known drugs (novel target opportunity)
3. **CLU** (genetic: 0.611) - Chaperone, complement regulation
   - Associated with anti-amyloid antibodies
4. **CR1** (genetic: 0.588) - Complement system
   - No known drugs (immunology opportunity)
5. **BIN1** (genetic: 0.585) - Endocytosis, tau pathology
   - No known drugs (novel mechanism opportunity)

**Tractability Summary**:
- 10/20 targets have antibody tractability
- 9/20 targets have small molecule tractability
- 12/20 targets have clinical precedence

**Known Drugs**: 8/20 targets have existing drugs (36 total drugs)

## Notes

- Genetic evidence is considered the gold standard for target validation
- Targets without known drugs represent novel opportunities
- Tractability assessment helps prioritize developable targets
- Clinical precedence indicates established mechanisms
- Score thresholds should be adjusted based on disease and goals
