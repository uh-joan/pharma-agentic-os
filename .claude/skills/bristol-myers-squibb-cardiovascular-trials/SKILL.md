5. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist What's the competitive landscape for Bristol Myers Squibb in cardiovascular disease?`


## Purpose
Retrieves and analyzes Bristol Myers Squibb's complete cardiovascular clinical trials portfolio from ClinicalTrials.gov. Provides comprehensive view of BMS cardiovascular R&D activities across all trial phases and statuses.

## Usage
Use this skill when you need:
- Bristol Myers Squibb cardiovascular pipeline analysis
- BMS cardiology trial portfolio assessment
- Competitive intelligence on BMS heart disease programs
- Historical view of BMS cardiovascular R&D
- Status distribution of BMS cardiovascular trials
- Phase progression analysis of BMS cardiology studies

## Data Retrieved
- **Total trials**: 275 cardiovascular trials
- **Status breakdown**: Completed (197), Terminated (41), Active not recruiting (17), Recruiting (9), Withdrawn (6), Unknown (5)
- **Phase breakdown**: Phase 3 (160), Phase 2 (59), Phase 4 (25), Phase 1 (10), and others
- **Coverage**: All historical and current BMS cardiovascular trials
- **Pagination**: 3 pages fetched for complete dataset

## Implementation Details

### Query Strategy
- **Primary query**: "Bristol Myers Squibb cardiovascular"
- **Pagination**: Token-based with 1000 results per page
- **Response format**: CT.gov markdown (requires regex parsing)

### Proven Patterns Applied
Adapted from `get_glp1_trials` reference skill:
1. **Pagination logic**: Token-based loop until no more pages
2. **Markdown parsing**: Regex-based trial block extraction
3. **Status aggregation**: Dictionary counting with frequency sorting
4. **Phase aggregation**: Additional distribution analysis
5. **Return format**: Consistent structure with summary statistics

### Technical Approach
- Regex pattern `###\s+\d+\.\s+NCT\d{8}` to split trial blocks
- Field extraction via `\*\*Field:\*\*\s*(.+?)(?:\n|$)` pattern
- Graceful handling of optional fields (not all trials have all metadata)
- Page token detection: `` `pageToken:\s*"([^"]+)"` ``

## Return Format
```python
{
    'total_count': 275,
    'trials': [...],  # Raw trial data
    'summary': {
        'total_count': 275,
        'status_distribution': {...},
        'phase_distribution': {...},
        'pages_fetched': 3
    }
}
```
