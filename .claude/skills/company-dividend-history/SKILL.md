## Use Cases

- **Dividend sustainability**: Is company paying more than it generates in cash flow?
- **Income investing**: Assess dividend reliability and growth potential
- **Shareholder returns**: Compare dividends to buybacks for total shareholder return
- **Capital allocation**: Understand balance between growth investments and shareholder payouts
- **Dividend growth**: Track dividend increases over time

## Key Metrics

**Payout Ratio (Operating Cash Flow)** = Dividends / Operating CF
- <40%: Growth-oriented (retaining cash for investments)
- 40-60%: Balanced (growth + income)
- 60-80%: Income-oriented (mature company)
- >80%: High payout (limited flexibility)
- >100%: Unsustainable (paying more than generating)

**Payout Ratio (Net Income)** = Dividends / Net Income
- <50%: Growth-oriented
- 50-70%: Balanced
- 70-90%: Income-oriented
- >90%: Potential dividend trap

**Dividend Growth**:
- >10% YoY: Strong growth (shareholder-friendly)
- 5-10% YoY: Moderate growth (stable)
- 0-5% YoY: Flat (maintaining commitment)
- <0% YoY: Declining (potential stress)
