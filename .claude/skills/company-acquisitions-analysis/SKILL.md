```

## Returns

```python
{
    'company_name': str,
    'acquisition_payments': [
        {'date': 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'amount': int, 'form': '10-K/10-Q'}
    ],
    'goodwill_trend': [
        {'date': 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'goodwill': int, 'change_pct': float}
    ],
    'impairments': [
        {'date': 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'amount': int}
    ],
    'summary': str  # Formatted output
}
```

## Use Cases

- Identify major acquisition years (explain segment volatility)
- Track goodwill growth (acquisition frequency indicator)
- Spot impairment risks (goodwill not generating returns)
- Analyze integration success (revenue synergies vs cost)
- Compare acquisition intensity across competitors

## Key Insights

- **Large spike in acquisition spend** = integration period ahead (volatility)
- **Goodwill growing faster than revenue** = acquisition-heavy growth
- **Goodwill stable** = organic growth period
- **Impairments** = acquisition integration failed
