## Sample Queries

Examples of user queries that would trigger reuse of this skill:

1. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Map the comprehensive CRISPR patent landscape across Broad Institute, UC Berkeley, and commercial entities`
2. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist What's the patent portfolio distribution between academic and commercial CRISPR patent holders?`
3. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Analyze CRISPR IP landscape for FTO assessment and licensing strategy`
4. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Show me patent families and geographic coverage for CRISPR gene editing technologies`
5. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Which institutions control the most CRISPR patents and what are the litigation indicators?`


## Purpose

Maps the comprehensive CRISPR patent landscape across key academic institutions and commercial entities, providing strategic IP intelligence for licensing decisions, FTO assessments, and competitive positioning.

## Key Features

- **Multi-entity tracking**: Academic (Broad Institute, UC Berkeley) vs Commercial (Editas, CRISPR Therapeutics, Intellia)
- **Patent family detection**: Identifies related patents and continuation series
- **Geographic coverage**: Maps patent protection across jurisdictions
- **Litigation indicators**: Flags patents with potential dispute keywords
- **Assignee categorization**: Automatically categorizes patents by institution/company

## Strategic Value

### Licensing Strategy
- Identify key patent holders in CRISPR space
- Understand patent concentration by entity
- Map licensing opportunities and requirements

### FTO Assessment
- Identify blocking patents for gene editing applications
- Map patent families that may impact product development
- Geographic coverage for market entry planning

### Competitive Intelligence
- Track commercial entity patent portfolios
- Monitor academic institution IP strategies
- Identify emerging patent families

## Usage Scenarios

**Licensing Due Diligence**:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=.claude:$PYTHONPATH python3 .claude/skills/crispr-ip-landscape/scripts/get_crispr_ip_landscape.py
```
→ Returns assignee breakdown, patent families, geographic coverage for licensing negotiation

**FTO Analysis**:
Use assignee data to identify which institutions control key CRISPR technologies and where patents are enforceable.

**Portfolio Benchmarking**:
Compare patent counts across academic vs commercial entities to assess IP strength.

## Implementation Details

### Search Strategy
1. **Multi-term search**: CRISPR, CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cas, full terminology variants
2. **Comprehensive coverage**: 500 patents per search term (1500+ total)
3. **Deduplication**: By patent number to avoid counting duplicates

### Assignee Categorization
- **Academic**: Broad Institute, MIT, Harvard, UC Berkeley, University of California
- **Commercial**: Editas Medicine, CRISPR Therapeutics, Intellia Therapeutics
- **Other**: All other assignees tracked separately

### Patent Family Detection
- Title-based similarity matching
- Detects continuation series (I, II, III, etc.)
- Groups related inventions

### Geographic Coverage
- Assignee location-based mapping
- Regions: United States, Europe, Asia
- Tracks patent protection by jurisdiction

### Litigation Indicators
- Keyword detection: interference, priority, dispute, challenge
- Flags potentially contested patents
- Useful for risk assessment

## Data Quality

- **Completeness**: Searches multiple CRISPR terminology variants
- **Accuracy**: Deduplicates by patent number
- **Recency**: Covers all granted USPTO patents
- **Breadth**: Captures academic, commercial, and other assignees
