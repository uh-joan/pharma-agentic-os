## Sample Queries

Examples of user queries that would trigger reuse of this skill:

1. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Which companies are working on KRAS inhibitors?`
2. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Who's developing GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity?`
3. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Show me the competitive landscape for BTK inhibitor development`
4. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist What companies have PD-1 antibody programs in clinical development?`
5. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Identify companies working on ADC mechanisms for oncology`


## Purpose

Fast competitive query tool to answer "Who's working on [mechanism]?"

Focuses on:
- Company identification by mechanism of action
- Development stage assessment (Phase 1/2/3, approved)
- Competitive positioning (leaders vs followers)
- Quick screening for partnership/acquisition opportunities

## Usage

**Direct execution**:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=.claude:$PYTHONPATH python3 .claude/skills/companies-by-moa/scripts/get_companies_by_moa.py "KRAS inhibitor"

# With disease filter
PYTHONPATH=.claude:$PYTHONPATH python3 .claude/skills/companies-by-moa/scripts/get_companies_by_moa.py "PD-1 antibody" "melanoma"
```

**Import and use**:
```python
from skills.companies_by_moa.scripts.get_companies_by_moa import get_companies_by_moa

result = get_companies_by_moa("BTK inhibitor")
print(f"Total companies: {result['total_companies']}")
print(f"Leaders: {result['competitive_summary']['leaders']}")
```

## Parameters

- `moa` (required): Mechanism of action (e.g., "KRAS inhibitor", "GLP-1 agonist")
- `disease` (optional): Disease filter (e.g., "NSCLC", "diabetes")
- `phase_filter` (optional): Minimum phase (default: "Phase 1")
- `include_academic` (optional): Include academic sponsors (default: False)
- `sample_size` (optional): Number of trials to analyze (default: None = full analysis)

## Output Structure

Returns dict with:
- `moa`: Mechanism queried
- `disease`: Disease filter (if applied)
- `total_trials`: Total trials found by CT.gov query
- `sample_size`: Number of trials actually analyzed
- `analyzed_trials`: Trials with valid sponsor/drug data
- `total_companies`: Count of unique companies
- `companies`: Dict with company details:
  - `trials`: Trial count
  - `phases`: List of phases company is active in
  - `drugs`: List of drug names
  - `approved`: Count of approved drugs
  - `lead_phase`: Most advanced phase
- `competitive_summary`:
  - `leaders`: Companies with approved drugs
  - `late_stage`: Companies in Phase 3+
  - `early_stage`: Companies in Phase 1/2 only
  - `assessment`: Narrative competitive summary

## When to Use This vs indication-drug-pipeline-breakdown

| Feature | This Skill (companies-by-moa) | pipeline-breakdown |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Query type | By mechanism of action | By indication (disease) |
| Focus | Companies and competitive positioning | Drugs and phase distribution |
| Coverage | Full analysis (all trials) | Full analysis with intelligent sampling |
| Example | "KRAS inhibitors" → Companies | "NSCLC" → All drugs/phases |
| Use case | Partnership screening | Pipeline strategy |

## Implementation Details

### Core Strategy

1. **Query CT.gov** for trials matching mechanism of action
2. **Extract sponsors** from trial data with M&A attribution
3. **Track per company**: trials, phases, drugs, lead phase
4. **Cross-check FDA** for approved drugs (sample for speed)
5. **Generate competitive summary** with strategic categories

### M&A Attribution

Reuses company hierarchy from `indication-drug-pipeline-breakdown`:
- Celgene → Bristol Myers Squibb
- Mirati Therapeutics → Bristol Myers Squibb
- Loxo Oncology → Eli Lilly
- Array BioPharma → Pfizer
- + 20 more mappings

### Academic Filtering

Optional removal of non-pharma sponsors using pattern matching:
- Universities, hospitals, medical centers
- Government institutions (NIH, NCI)
- Non-profit foundations

Default: `include_academic=False` (pharma-only focus)

## Limitations

1. **Performance**: Full analysis of large trial sets (>500 trials) takes 30-60 seconds
2. **MoA matching**: Text-based search (may miss synonyms)
3. **Academic filter**: Pattern-based (some edge cases)
4. **FDA API rate limits**: May slow down with very large drug lists (>100 unique drugs)

## Related Skills

- **indication-drug-pipeline-breakdown**: Complementary skill for disease-wide analysis
- **get_clinical_trials**: Basic trial search (no company tracking)
- **competitive-landscape-analyst**: Strategic agent using both skills

## Verification

Verified with:
- ✅ Execution: Clean exit, no errors
- ✅ Data retrieved: Company data extracted
- ✅ M&A attribution: Celgene → Bristol Myers Squibb working
- ✅ Executable: Standalone with `if __name__`
- ✅ Schema: Valid company structure
