# get_indication_pipeline_attrition

## Purpose
Track terminated and withdrawn clinical trials for any therapeutic area to identify failure patterns, competitive intelligence, and development risks.

## Usage
Use this skill when you need to:
- Assess clinical development risks for a therapeutic area
- Identify which companies have had trial failures
- Understand common failure points (Phase 1, 2, 3)
- De-risk investment decisions based on attrition patterns
- Competitive intelligence on failed programs

## Parameters
- `indication` (str): Therapeutic area, drug class, or mechanism
  - Examples: "KRAS inhibitor", "obesity", "GLP-1", "Alzheimer's"
- `sample_size` (int, optional): Number of trials to analyze in detail (default: None = full analysis)

## Returns
Dictionary containing:
- `indication`: The therapeutic area analyzed
- `total_terminated`: Count of terminated trials
- `total_withdrawn`: Count of withdrawn trials
- `total_attrition`: Total failed trials found by CT.gov query
- `sample_size`: Number of trials actually analyzed in detail
- `analyzed_trials`: Trials with complete phase/sponsor data
- `phase_breakdown`: Attrition by development phase
- `top_sponsors`: Top 10 sponsors with most failures
- `interventions`: Sample list of failed interventions
- `summary`: Human-readable analysis

## Implementation Details

### Query Strategy
1. Searches CT.gov for trials matching indication
2. Filters for status: TERMINATED or WITHDRAWN
3. Uses pagination to capture all results (pageSize=1000)
4. Parses markdown to extract trial metadata

### Analysis Dimensions
- **Phase Distribution**: Counts failures by Phase 1, 2, 3, 4
- **Sponsor Patterns**: Identifies top sponsors with most failures
- **Status Breakdown**: Separates terminated vs withdrawn
- **Intervention Extraction**: Lists failed drug candidates

### Data Quality
- Complete pagination ensures all attrition captured
- Markdown parsing handles CT.gov response format
- Robust field extraction with regex patterns
- Handles missing/optional fields gracefully

## Example Output
```
Pipeline Attrition Analysis for KRAS inhibitor
============================================================

Total Attrition: 78 trials
  - Terminated: 65
  - Withdrawn: 13

Phase Breakdown:
  - Phase 1: 28
  - Phase 2: 35
  - Phase 3: 12
  - Phase 4: 1
  - Other/Not Applicable: 2

Top 5 Sponsors with Failed Trials:
  1. Amgen: 8 trials
  2. Mirati Therapeutics Inc.: 6 trials
  3. Boehringer Ingelheim: 5 trials
  4. Revolution Medicines, Inc.: 4 trials
  5. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center: 3 trials
```

## Use Cases
1. **Investment Due Diligence**: Assess clinical risk before investing
2. **Competitive Analysis**: Identify which competitors have failed programs
3. **Development Strategy**: Understand common failure points to avoid
4. **Market Timing**: Gauge field maturity based on attrition rates
5. **Partnership Evaluation**: Vet potential partners' track record
