description: >
  Identifies validated targets for cancer immunotherapy beyond PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors.
  Searches Open Targets for immune checkpoint, T-cell activation, and immune modulation targets
  with cancer associations. Filters out PD-1/PD-L1 to focus on next-generation opportunities.
  Returns targets prioritized by clinical precedence, antibody tractability, and cancer indications.

  Use this skill when exploring:
  - Next-generation checkpoint inhibitors
  - Novel immunotherapy targets
  - Cancer immunology drug targets
  - Therapeutic antibody opportunities
  - Immune modulation mechanisms

## Sample Queries

Examples of user queries that would trigger reuse of this skill:

1. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist What are next-generation checkpoint inhibitor targets beyond PD-1/PD-L1?`
2. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Show me novel cancer immunotherapy targets with antibody tractability`
3. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Find validated immune checkpoint targets like CTLA-4, LAG-3, and TIM-3`
4. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Which cancer immunotherapy targets have clinical precedence outside of PD-1?`
5. `@agent-pharma-search-specialist Identify emerging T-cell modulation targets for oncology drug development`


## Purpose
Discovers and prioritizes validated targets for cancer immunotherapy beyond the well-established PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, enabling next-generation therapeutic development.

## Usage
Execute this skill when you need to:
- Identify novel immunotherapy targets for cancer
- Explore alternatives to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
- Assess antibody tractability for immune targets
- Find targets with clinical precedence in oncology
- Discover emerging checkpoint inhibitor opportunities

## Business Value
- **Pipeline Innovation**: Identify next-generation checkpoint inhibitors
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Move beyond crowded PD-1/PD-L1 space
- **Target Validation**: Leverage genetic evidence and clinical precedence
- **Strategic Planning**: Assess antibody vs small molecule opportunities
- **Risk Mitigation**: Focus on clinically validated mechanisms

## Implementation Details

### Search Strategy
Queries Open Targets using multiple immunotherapy-related terms:
- Immune checkpoint mechanisms
- T-cell activation pathways
- Tumor immunology targets
- Cytotoxic T lymphocyte markers
- Natural killer cell receptors

### Filtering Logic
- **Excludes**: PD-1 (PDCD1/ENSG00000188389) and PD-L1 (CD274/ENSG00000120217)
- **Deduplicates**: Removes targets found via multiple search terms
- **Focuses**: Cancer-associated indications only

### Prioritization Criteria
Targets sorted by:
1. Clinical precedence (adverse effects data = clinical experience)
2. Antibody tractability (Clinical Precedence tier)
3. Number of cancer indications

### Data Extracted
For each target:
- Gene symbol and Ensembl ID
- Full target name
- Antibody tractability assessment
- Small molecule tractability assessment
- Top 3 cancer indications
- Clinical precedence indicator
- Discovery search term

## Output Format

### Summary Statistics
- Total validated targets found
- Antibody tractable targets (Clinical Precedence)
- Small molecule tractable targets
- Targets with clinical precedence

### Top 15 Priority Targets
Detailed information for highest-priority targets including:
