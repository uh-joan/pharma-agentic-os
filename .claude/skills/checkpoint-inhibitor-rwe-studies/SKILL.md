  Search PubMed for real-world evidence (RWE) studies on checkpoint inhibitor effectiveness.
  Analyzes real-world performance vs clinical trial efficacy, including real-world response rates,
  survival data (OS, PFS), and patient selection patterns. Covers PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, and
  combination therapies.
