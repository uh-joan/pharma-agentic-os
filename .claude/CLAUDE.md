# Pharmaceutical Research Intelligence

## Architecture

**Multi-agent pattern**: Data gathering + analytical agents

**Agents**:

**Use for**: Task Master workflows, complex analytical pipelines, multi-phase projects
**Invoked by**: `/create-plan` command

See `.claude/agents/search-orchestrator.md` for plan format and examples.

## Execution Protocol

### 1. Determine Workflow Type

**Use `search-orchestrator` for**:
- Multi-phase projects requiring Task Master workflows
- Complex analytical pipelines (data gathering → analysis → synthesis)
- Projects with context files (project-brief.md, user-profile.md, PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md)
- When using `/create-plan` command
- Workflows requiring multiple specialist agents in sequence

**Use `pharma-search-specialist` for**:
- Ad-hoc queries
- Simple data gathering (single or few MCP queries)
- Direct user questions without project context
- Quick lookups and explorations

### 2. If Using search-orchestrator

Template for `/create-plan` command:
```
"You are search-orchestrator. Read .claude/agents/search-orchestrator.md.

Analyze project context files and create comprehensive workflow plan with:
1. mcp_queries: Data gathering tasks (direct MCP tool calls)
2. specialist_delegations: Analysis tasks (specify which agents)
3. synthesis_plan: Final compilation and report generation

Return ONLY JSON plan."
```

See `/create-plan` command documentation for full workflow integration.

### 3. If Using pharma-search-specialist

#### 3a. Classify Query Complexity

**Simple** (single database, <5 steps):
- FDA approval status for specific drug
- Clinical trial count for condition
- PubMed articles on topic
- Patent search for compound
- Single entity lookup

**Complex** (multi-database, >5 steps):
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Market assessment
- KOL identification
- Safety signal detection
- Pipeline analysis
- Keywords: "competitive", "landscape", "compare", "analyze market", "identify leaders"

**Uncertain/Exploratory**:
- Novel questions without clear workflow
- Ambiguous entities or scope
- "What if" scenarios
- Open-ended research
- Keywords: "explore", "discover", "what are all", "map the space"

#### 3b. Invoke Specialist

Use the template matching the complexity classification from Step 1.

**For simple queries**:
```
Prompt: "You are pharma-search-specialist. Read .claude/agents/pharma-search-specialist.md.

```

**For complex queries** (multi-database, competitive analysis, workflows):
```
Prompt: "You are pharma-search-specialist. Read .claude/agents/pharma-search-specialist.md.

Query: '[user query]'

Read search-strategy-protocols.md (4-phase execution).
Read search-workflows.md (find similar workflow template).

Read cross-database-integration.md (if linking entities).
Read relevant tool guides (fda.md for FDA queries, clinicaltrials.md for CT.gov, pubmed.md for PubMed).
Return ONLY JSON execution plan."
```

**For uncertain/exploratory queries**:
```
Prompt: "You are pharma-search-specialist. Read .claude/agents/pharma-search-specialist.md.

Query: '[user query]'

Apply 'ultrathink' mode from search-strategy-protocols.md.
Read search-workflows.md for inspiration.
Read quality-control.md for validation criteria.
Read performance-optimization.md (MANDATORY count-first for FDA).
Read relevant tool guides (fda.md, clinicaltrials.md, pubmed.md, etc.).
Design custom workflow. Return ONLY JSON execution plan."
```

#### 3c. Execute Plan
Parse JSON → execute each step → save to `data_dump/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HHMMSS}_{tool}_{term}/` → present findings

**After execution**: Save raw MCP results to data_dump/, then optionally invoke analytical agents.

- `temp/patient_flow_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HHMMSS}_{drug_indication}.md`
- `temp/uptake_dynamics_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HHMMSS}_{drug_indication}.md`
- `temp/pricing_strategy_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HHMMSS}_{drug_indication}.md`
- `temp/revenue_forecast_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HHMMSS}_{drug_indication}.md`
- `temp/market_sizing_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HHMMSS}_{drug_indication}.md`

**Agent Constraint**: Analytical agents are read-only (tools: [Read]). Claude Code orchestrator handles file persistence.

## File Structure

**data_dump/**: Raw MCP results (query.json, results.json, summary.md, metadata.json)
**temp/**: Analytical agent outputs (epidemiology_analysis_*.md, patient_flow_*.md, uptake_dynamics_*.md, pricing_strategy_*.md, revenue_forecast_*.md, market_sizing_*.md, competitive_analysis_*.md, bd_opportunities_*.md, strategic_plan_*.md, deal_comparables_*.md, npv_analysis_*.md, deal_structure_*.md, target_identification_*.md, target_validation_*.md, target_druggability_*.md, target_hypothesis_*.md, safety_pharmacology_*.md, genetic_toxicology_*.md, toxicology_*.md, ind_package_*.md, rwe_study_design_*.md, rwe_outcomes_analysis_*.md, rwe_analytics_strategy_*.md) - written by Claude Code after agent execution
**.claude/.context/mcp-tool-guides/**: Tool documentation (DO NOT MODIFY)

## Token Efficiency

**Critical**: Task calls carry full conversation history (~50k tokens per call).

**Best Practices**:
1. Keep specialist prompts minimal (use template above)
2. After receiving execution plan, consider clearing context if conversation is long
3. Limit MCP results (max 50-100 records per query)
4. Use count/pagination before fetching large datasets

## Design Principles

1. **Multi-agent**: Planning agents (pharma-search-specialist for ad-hoc queries, search-orchestrator for projects) + analytical agents (epidemiology-analyst, patient-flow-modeler, uptake-dynamics-analyst, pricing-strategy-analyst, revenue-synthesizer, market-sizing-analyst, competitive-analyst, opportunity-identifier, strategy-synthesizer, comparable-analyst, npv-modeler, structure-optimizer, target-identifier, target-validator, target-druggability-assessor, target-hypothesis-synthesizer, safety-pharmacology-analyst, genetic-toxicology-analyst, toxicology-analyst, toxicologist-regulatory-strategist, rwe-study-designer, rwe-outcomes-analyst, rwe-analytics-strategist, regulatory-risk-analyst, regulatory-precedent-analyst, regulatory-pathway-analyst, regulatory-label-strategist, regulatory-adcomm-strategist)
2. **Separation of concerns**: Planning vs execution vs analysis - agents plan, Claude Code executes MCP queries, analysts process results
3. **Read-only analysts**: All analytical agents use only Read tool; Claude Code orchestrator handles file writes to temp/
4. **Token optimization**: Conservative limits, pagination, count strategies
5. **Audit trail**: Raw MCP results → data_dump/, analytical outputs → temp/
6. **Agent constraints**: Planning agents plan only (no execution), analytical agents read only (no writes), Claude Code handles all execution and file persistence
