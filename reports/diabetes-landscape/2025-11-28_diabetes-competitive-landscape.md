### Analysis Limitations

**Coverage Gaps**:
- ClinicalTrials.gov registration may lag (especially non-US trials)
- Some trials may lack detailed intervention data
- Small early-stage programs may not be registered

**Classification Challenges**:
- "Diabetes" captures Type 1, Type 2, gestational, complications
- Phase classification based on trial registration (may be ambiguous)
- Drug names may have multiple variants (brand, generic, code names)

**Temporal Considerations**:
- Snapshot analysis (2025-11-28)
- Pipeline dynamics change rapidly (new trials, terminations)
- Recommend quarterly updates for active monitoring
